"""
Data pipeline for the skill-metacognition + GRPO training run.

Stages implemented here:
  --build-sft          : build SFT jsonl from the skill-labeled dataset (+ hendrycks_math fallback)
  --diagnose            : evaluate a checkpoint, report accuracy by (subject, level)
  --augment-semantic     : semantic-preserving perturbation of weak clusters (prioritized)
  --augment-numeric       : numeric-literal perturbation with verification (secondary)
  --multi-solution        : rejection-sampled diverse correct solutions for weak clusters

Design notes:
  - "think" section = short skill label + semantic extraction (entities/quantities/
    relations/operation type), not just a category tag - built from the skill-labeled
    dataset's own reasoning_trace, which already carries inline [SKILL: ...] tags.
  - Semantic perturbation is meaning-preserving -> gold answer is reused as-is.
  - Numeric perturbation requires verification (self-consistency vote) before being
    accepted into the training set.
  - All augmentation functions batch model calls across problems rather than looping
    one problem at a time - see run_augmentation.py for the model-connected drivers.
  - Every write path auto-creates its parent directory; every read path fails with a
    clear message if missing, rather than silently creating an empty directory next
    to a file that was never there.
