"""
Flexible environment check: reports what's already installed and only tells
you what's ACTUALLY missing or too old - never proposes reinstalling something
that's already present and adequate. This matters because many training
environments (vendor Docker images, Kaggle/Colab, cluster modules) come with
torch/vllm/etc. already installed and pinned to a version that works with that
specific hardware/driver stack; blindly running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
in those environments can downgrade or break a working setup.

Usage:
  python check_environment.py            # report only, installs nothing
  python check_environment.py --install-missing   # also pip-installs whatever
                                                    # is genuinely absent (never
                                                    # touches already-installed
                                                    # packages, even if older
                                                    # than the suggested minimum)
